# RFDuinoLedButtonInSwift
Controlling an RFDuino using Swift. Using the ObjectiveC imported Library. 


This is a Swift translation of https://github.com/RFduino/RFduinoApps/tree/master/iPhone%20Apps/rfduinoLedButton

It still uses the library in Objective-C, that can be found in https://github.com/RFduino/RFduinoApps/tree/master/iPhone%20Apps

The AppDelegate, however, and the ViewController, are in Swift.
